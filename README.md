## About
Hello, fancy seeing you reading this. Nothing much tho im just writing this section for fun
. Basically i built this site by yoink-ing a W3school base template and modify it to my liking.
Didnt really care much about browser compatibility, code cleanliness, or accesibility if youre wondering. Mainly focusing on the appearance. Tho i may still improve and tidy up stuff whenever i find the time.

## Why am i doing this
Its fun! I always enjoyed customising personal blog(s) on various platforms when i was young. Its a form of art.
